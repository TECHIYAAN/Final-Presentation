### Introduction 
Project Proposals/Presentations are the foundations of a project. Such presentations in the “real-world” can ensure financial and resource support. It also allows you to reflect on the final product you have, the resources you need to mass produce the project, and the new skills you acquired during the project. Proposals also allow you to plan your project realistically while keeping your vision alive. This project will emphasize this aspect of the engineering design process. 
In this project, you are expected to work with your partner from the GeoGuesser project and present your work and insights to the rest of the class. You will be required to do the following:
1. Run the GeoGuesser that you and your partner built. 
2. Speak about the challenges that you faced while creating the game (with the aid of slides if desired)
3. Speak about the new skills and concepts you learned in the process (with the aid of slides if desired)
4. Now that you have acquired some new skills, propose another game or project you would like to create. Also mention how you would approach making this game or a part of this game (with the aid of slides).
   - For example, if you wish to create a tic-tac-toe talk about either, how you would approach the display, how you would check when the user has won, or how to differentiate between user inputs, etc. 
5. Listen to/take feedback/questions on the newly proposed 
### Goals 
1.	Give each student an opportunity to work in a team-setting and develop their communication and collaboration skills

3.	Give each team the occasion to present ideas formally, instilling an understanding of how to articulate ideas and be heard in a public forum. 
4.	Giving each student the chance to critically evaluate projects and ideas. 
5.	Encouraging teams to take constructive criticisms. 
### Deliverables and Expectations 
1.	Run the GeoGuesser program live
2.	Orally present the answers and proposal mentioned above in 10-15 minutes
